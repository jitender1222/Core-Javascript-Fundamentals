`setTimeout(() => {`
`console.log("first");`
`setTimeout(() => {`
`console.log("second");`
`}, 2000);`
`}, 5000); `
Here's what happens:

The first setTimeout with a delay of 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) is called. The timer starts counting down.

While the first timer is counting down, the JavaScript engine continues executing the rest of the code. The second setTimeout with a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) is called inside the first callback.

The second timer is set to wait, but it does not affect the countdown of the first timer. The timers work independently, and their execution order is based on the event loop and the elapsed time, not the order in which they were called.

After approximately 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) have passed, the first timer's countdown completes, and its associated callback function (console.log("first")) is added to the callback queue.

The JavaScript engine checks the event loop, and since the call stack is empty, it dequeues the first callback and executes it, logging "first" to the console.

Now, the JavaScript engine continues checking for additional tasks in the callback queue. The second timer is still counting down and has approximately 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds) left to complete.

Eventually, after approximately 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) from the time it was called, the second timer's countdown completes, and its associated callback function (console.log("second")) is added to the callback queue.

The JavaScript engine checks the event loop again and, since the call stack is empty, dequeues the second callback and executes it, logging "second" to the console.

To summarize, even though the 2000-millisecond timer was set to expire first, it did not do so because the first timer had already completed and its callback was executed first. The execution order of timers depends on when they were scheduled and the current state of the event loop. The timers execute in the order they are scheduled unless the event loop is busy with other tasks, causing some timers to delay their execution.
